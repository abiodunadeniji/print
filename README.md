- `%c`: Prints a single character.
- `%s`: Prints a null-terminated string.
- `%d`, `%i`, `%u`, `%o`, `%x`, `%X`: Prints signed or unsigned integers in decimal, octal, or hexadecimal format.
- `%p`: Prints a pointer address.
- `%S`: Prints a string with non-printable characters represented in the format `\xXX`, where `XX` is the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (always two characters in uppercase).
